# Purpose of Data Collection

This data is being collected purely for educational purposes. The resulting dataset will not in any way be commercialized.

# Robots.txt Consideration

The blog which was used for the list of 100 places had no restrictions in its robots.txt file in terms of being scraped for access to its data.

# Usage Limits and Attribution

Full credit for sunrise and sunset information/data goes to https://sunrise-sunset.org/api. The site creators request that the request volume be reasonable. The program fulfills this request by adding delays between calls of 1 second. This program is also used to create a dataset updated at most daily.
